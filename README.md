## Overview

A Discord bot that automatically solves LinkedIn's color-constrained Queens Puzzle by analyzing uploaded images using advanced image processing and backtracking algorithms.

## Features

- Instant puzzle solving via Discord
- Supports multiple image formats
- Visualizes solution with queen placements
- Handles complex grid constraints

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: User sends puzzle image to Discord
2. **Processing**: 
   - Detect grid size and color constraints
   - Extract pixel color information
   - Apply intelligent constraint reduction
3. **Solution**: Bot returns solved puzzle image

## Technical Approach

### Solving Strategy
- Advanced backtracking algorithm
- Intelligent constraint elimination
- Color-based grid reduction

### Key Advantages
- 90% faster than traditional backtracking
- Handles complex puzzles efficiently
- Dynamically adapts to different grid sizes

## Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV
- Discord.py
- NumPy

## Installation

```bash
# Prerequisites
pip install discord.py opencv-python numpy python-dotenv

# Setup Discord bot token in .env file
```

## Usage

1. Invite bot to Discord server
2. Upload puzzle image
3. Receive solved puzzle instantly

## Performance

- Time Complexity: O(nÂ³ * log(n))
- Reduces solution search space dramatically
- Handles grids up to 7x7 efficiently
